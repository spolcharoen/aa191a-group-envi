# AA191a Group Page: Sustainability and Environmental Issues
### Members: Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen, Penelope (Lillan) Lamb, Alexis Hatalski

The social problem our group will be addressing is sustainability and environmental issues in Los Angeles. Currently, we are looking to gauge the impact of redlining on specific areas in LA, specifically in regard to environmental impacts. We are aiming to empower communities that have been ignored by their political representatives and showcase their stories through our maps.
